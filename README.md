Changes 2017-01-24:
* removed supervisor as most people use their own supervision solution (Marathon, Swarm, even --restart=always)
* dropped privileges to unifi, because security.

**MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATA BEFORE INSTALLING UPDATES.**
**Database rollback from newer to older versions isn't always possible.**
**Export a .unf from the web interface and/or stop the current container and make a backup copy of the data volume.**


## Usage

This container exposes two volumes:
* `/usr/lib/unifi/data` - UniFi configuration data and DBs
* `/usr/lib/unifi/logs` - UniFi and MongoDB logs for troubleshooting

This container exposes the following ports (see: https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/218506997-UniFi-Ports-Used):
* `3478/udp` (port used for STUN connection)
* `6789/tcp` (port used for throughput measurement from Android/iOS app)
* `8080/tcp` (port for UAP/USW/USG to inform controller)
* `8443/tcp` (port for controller GUI / API)
* `8880/tcp` (port for HTTP portal redirect)
* `8843/tcp` (port for HTTPS portal redirect)
* `10001/udp` (port used for UBNT discovery broadcasts - Local LAN/L2/same subnet **only**)

---

The most basic way to start this container:

```
$ docker run --name unifi -d \
	-p 3478:3478/udp -p 6789:6789 -p 8080:8080 \
	-p 8443:8443 -p 8880:8880 -p 8843:8843 \
	goofball222/unifi
```


Recommended:
Have the container store the config/databases (recommended for persistence), logs on your filesystem instead (recommended for troubleshooting!), and allow for remapping ports with NO layer 2 discovery (layer 3/remote controller):

```
$ docker run --name unifi -d \
	-p 3478:3478/udp -p 6789:6789 -p 8080:8080 \
	-p 8443:8443 -p 8880:8880 -p 8843:8843 \
	-v /path/to/data:/usr/lib/unifi/data  \
	-v /path/to/logs:/usr/lib/unifi/logs \
	goofball222/unifi
```


To enable layer 2/local LAN discovery:

```
$ docker run --name unifi -d \
	-p 3478:3478/udp -p 6789:6789 -p 8080:8080 \
	-p 8443:8443 -p 8880:8880 -p 8843:8843 \
	-p 10001:10001/udp \
	-v /path/to/data:/usr/lib/unifi/data  \
	-v /path/to/logs:/usr/lib/unifi/logs \
	goofball222/unifi
```


Alternative suggested by rogierlommers: 

Use --network=host mode. Does not allow for port remapping. You may need to manually adjust host firewall settings to allow traffic. Running a container in this mode is considered insecure:
**Please make sure to read the "Network: host" section of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/ and understand the implications of this setting before using.**

```
$ docker run --name unifi -d \
	--network=host \
	-v /path/to/data:/usr/lib/unifi/data  \
	-v /path/to/logs:/usr/lib/unifi/logs \
	goofball222/unifi
```
